# PIZZA_SALS_ANALYIS
Creating a pizza sales analysis using Power BI and SQL involves extracting relevant data from a SQL database, modeling it in Power BI, and creating visualizations for insights. 
The SQL database would likely contain tables related to sales transactions, customer information, and pizza details. Power BI is then used to connect to the SQL database, import data, create relationships between tables, and design visualizations such as charts and graphs to analyze pizza sales trends, popular pizza choices, customer demographics, and other relevant insights. 
The goal is to use Power BI's reporting capabilities to present a comprehensive and visually appealing analysis of pizza sales data for informed decision-making.
